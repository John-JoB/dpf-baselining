    "# Pydpf Basics Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial gives a basic overview of the differentiable particle filtering package, pydpf. The package is intended to implement the majority of differentiable filters currently available in the literature and provide a convenient API for training them. It is part of a larger project to develop a benchmarking suite for DPFs. This tutorial assumes good knowledge of pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design principles\n",
    "1. Extensibility\n",
    "    It should be as easy as possible for a user to define and train a filter to their needs without the package getting in the way. It should generally be possible to extend the functionality we provide by passing values to package functions, rather than subclassing package classes.\n",
    "2. Pytorch semantics\n",
    "    This module integrates with pytorch. Typical torch semantics are preserved as much as possible.\n",
    "3. Learning functions not models.\n",
    "    Conceptually it is best to think of modules written for pydpf as learning an algorithm to achieve the given inference goal, not a specific state space model. This gives the user flexibility in structuring their model as best suited to their problem rather than having to conform to the package's syntax. Most particle filtering algorithms are implementable as 'models' that can be passed to our base SMC algorithms, rather than needing to design them from scratch. Conversely, this puts the responsibility of designing well-structured and correct filtering algorithms on the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overarching design patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### The pydpf.Module class\n",
    "pydpf has a custom Module class that extends torch.nn.Module. pydpf.Module subclasses can optionally contain an update() method that should be used to calculate derived quantities from, or constrain parameters after they have changed. We recommend that all custom modules defined for use with pydpf subclass pydpf.Module. update() is called recursively on submodules, for this reason it is safe for pydf.Module classes to have torch.nn.Module submodules but not vice versa. So, there is no issue in using built in torch modules. Consequently, it is not safe to directly set attributes of a Module, one should provide a safe set_attribute method for Module attributes. The exception to this rule is when using torch's (somewhat arcane) optimizers which update the parameters inplace. One should then make sure to call .update() on all root Modules following an Optimizer step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataformat\n",
    "@Ben this is subject to change if required. The data-format currently required by the pydpf data loading faculties is a folder of .csv files where each file contains a trajectory. Each file should have two columns, labelled state and observations containing vectors in the format '[state_1, state_2, ..., state_n]' (quotes included). Other columns are permitted but will be ignored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of dimensions\n",
    "The order of dimensions shall be: time, batch, particle, state/observation-dimension. Frequently one or more of these dimensions shall not be present but they should not change relative order."

    "We include a distributions module to implement common distributions (and conditional distributions) with a convenient API. Like the torch.distributions package it is not intended for the user to subclass the Distribution object, if they wish to implement their own it will always be easier to manually define sampling and density evaluation methods. Distribution objects implement a sample() and log_density() method, the specific arguments of which depend on the specific distribution. Distributions are pydpf.Module subclasses so may be assigned parameters. Distributions give three built in options for the gradient estimator to use for sampling, 'reparameterisation' reparameterisation trick, 'score' score-based/REINFORCE, and 'none' detach gradients. Although, attaching a score-based gradient estimator to the sample requires doing so in linear-space, whereas attaching it to the importance weights can be done in log-space so may be more stable in practice."
